# Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) Digital Circuit Design

## üß† Description

This project focuses on the exploration and development of digital circuits using **Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA)** ‚Äî a promising post-CMOS nanotechnology that allows for the design of high-density, ultra-low-power digital systems. Unlike traditional transistor-based circuits, QCA encodes binary information using the position of electrons within quantum cells, enabling computation at nanoscale dimensions.

Using **QCADesigner**, a widely accepted tool for QCA simulation and layout design, this project implements a range of fundamental digital components including:

- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Multiplexers
- Flip-flops (D and JK)
- Registers
- A 3-stage LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) based Pseudo-Random Number Generator

All circuits are simulated for correct logical behavior and optimized for power and space efficiency. The project also highlights a comparative advantage over traditional CMOS circuits, achieving approximately **15% better power efficiency**.
